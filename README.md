This is a hackthon project our team designed for 2019 HTN (Hack the north)

It is a emotion changing software. If u are happy, it will give u some bad quotes. If u are upset, it will give u some great jokes to cheer u up.

It uses Microsoft Azure APIs: cosomos database, speech-to-text, facial recognition etc. 

I mainly take charge of connecting database and text-to-speech function.
